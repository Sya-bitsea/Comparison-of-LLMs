    {
      "question": "What is the proposed reason for the emission quenching of the Cu(I)-MOF by encapsulated water molecules?",
      "answer": "The emission quenching by encapsulated water is proposed to be due to non-radiative energy transfer, since the water molecules are suspended in the cavities and not directly bound to the framework.",

      "question": "What causes the emission of the Cu(I)-MOF to blue-shift slightly when formaldehyde is encapsulated compared to the hydrated form?",
      "answer": "The slight blue-shift in emission when formaldehyde is encapsulated is likely due to the increased structural rigidity imposed by the host-guest interactions and the structural variations in the Cu2I2 core.",

    {
      "question": "Why is the development of formaldehyde sensors, especially convenient colorimetric ones, very important?",
      "answer": "Formaldehyde is a harmful indoor pollutant widely used in construction and decoration materials. Convenient colorimetric sensors are needed to easily detect dangerous formaldehyde levels, as concentrations above 20 ppm are immediately dangerous to life and health.",

      "question": "How does the Cu(I)-MOF's ability to detect formaldehyde in the presence of water compare to other formaldehyde sensors?",
