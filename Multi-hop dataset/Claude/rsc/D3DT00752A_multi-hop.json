    "question": "Why is an external magnetic field required to observe the slow magnetic relaxation in the Dy-Cu complex 2?",
    "answer": "An external magnetic field is required to suppress the quantum tunneling of magnetization (QTM) of the Dy(III) ions in complex 2, which can mask the slow magnetic relaxation. Applying a field of 1900 Oe effectively suppressed the QTM and allowed the observation of the frequency-dependent χ'' signals.",
