    "answer": "No, the Cm3+ L3-edge EXAFS data alone did not provide an unambiguous picture of the inner-sphere speciation in 4 M acetate. Shell-by-shell fits including acetate were reasonable, but a simple aquo-ion model without any acetates also fit the data equally well.

    "answer": "The main evidence for acetate complexation from the optical measurements was an increase in the fluorescence lifetime of Cm3+ in going from dilute to intermediate to concentrated acetate, consistent with displacement of quenching inner-sphere water ligands by acetate anions.
