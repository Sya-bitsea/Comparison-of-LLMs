    "question": "What is the proposed mechanism for the regioselective C(sp3)–H arylation reaction catalyzed by Cd-MIX?",
    "answer": "The proposed mechanism involves Cd-MIX acting as a dual-functional catalyst, combining hydrogen atom transfer and photoredox catalysis. The excited Cd-MIX reduces an electron-deficient radical precursor to form an anionic radical and oxidized Ar3N•+, which selectively abstracts a hydrogen atom from the C(sp3)–H bond. The two radicals then couple to form the arylation product.",
