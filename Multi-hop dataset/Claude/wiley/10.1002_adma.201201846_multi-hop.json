      "type": "factual",
      "difficulty": "medium"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does compound 1 likely exhibit guest-induced luminescence from the MV2+ cations?",
      "answer": "The MV2+ cations are highly ordered and almost planar in the crystal structure, which prevents fast radiationless deactivation of their excited state that would lead to non-emissive decay.",

      "difficulty": "hard"
    },
    {
      "question": "What causes the lower energy emission band at 544 nm for compound 1?",
      "answer": "It is likely due to interaction between the MV2+ species and the Cu nodes, since they are only ~3.7 Å apart in the crystal structure.",

      "difficulty": "hard" 
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does adsorption of CO2 result in a red-shift of the emission, while adsorption of H2O and CH3OH cause a blue-shift?",
      "answer": "This is likely due to differences in the specific adsorption sites for CO2, CH3OH and H2O and the different adsorption capacities of the anhydrous derivative for these adsorbates, which affects the Cu-MV distances.",
      "type": "reasoning",
      "difficulty": "hard"
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes compound 1 an excellent candidate for fabrication of chemical sensors?",

    },
    {
      "question": "What type of magnetic ordering is observed in compound 1 below 19 K?",
      "answer": "Long-range 3D ferromagnetic ordering, likely due to weak dipolar or through-bond interactions between adjacent layers mediated by the hydrogen-bonded water molecules.",

      "difficulty": "hard"
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes compound 1 a unique example of a luminescent porous magnet?",

    {
      "question": "True or False: Compound 1 exhibits ligand-based luminescence from the mpba4- bridging ligands.",
      "answer": "False. The luminescence originates from the MV2+ cations and their interaction with the Cu nodes.",
