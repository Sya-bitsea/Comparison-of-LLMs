    "question": "What are the two chemically distinct types of Fe(II) ions present in the structure of Dpya-1?",
    "answer": "Dpya-1 contains two chemically distinct types of Fe(II) ions: 1) Two ions (Fe2) that are part of the original dinuclear building block, and 2) One metal center (Fe1) that connects the dimers pairwise to generate infinite 1D chains.",

  {
    "question": "What is the coordination environment of the Fe2 centers in Dpya-1?",

  {
    "question": "What happens to the structure and properties of Dpya-1 when the propionitrile solvent molecules are exchanged with water to form Dpya-2?",
    "answer": "The exchange of propionitrile with water molecules causes a shortening of the distances separating the polymer chains, reducing the size of the nanopores. This is accompanied by a color change from deep purple to pale yellow, indicating the Fe2 centers change spin state from low-spin to high-spin at room temperature, suppressing the spin-crossover properties.",

  {
    "question": "How does the spin-crossover behavior of Dpya-1 change when the propionitrile is replaced by acetonitrile compared to 1-propanol?",
    "answer": "Replacing propionitrile with acetonitrile maintains the spin-crossover behavior, but shifts the transition temperature lower by 20K to around 273K. In contrast, exchanging with 1-propanol suppresses the spin-crossover completely, similar to the case of water exchange, likely due to a larger reduction in the ligand field strength around the Fe2 centers.",

  {
    "question": "What makes the Dpya-1 material unique compared to other nanoporous switchable functional materials?",
    "answer": "The nanoporous structure of Dpya-1 allows external solvent molecules to access and exchange with the magnetically active Fe(II) centers. This enables the physical properties to be reversibly modified through a true chemical process of ligand exchange, rather than just removal/inclusion of guest molecules as in most other systems.",

    "answer": "The spin-crossover transition shifts to a lower temperature by about 20 K with acetonitrile compared to propionitrile likely because acetonitrile exerts a slightly weaker ligand field on the Fe2 centers.",
