**Reasoning Questions:**

1. **Question:** Why is the almost planar conformation of the MV<sup>2+</sup> cations in compound **1** significant for its luminescent properties?
   **Answer:**  Because significant rotation around the single bond connecting the two pyridinium rings in MV<sup>2+</sup> leads to fast radiationless deactivation of the singlet excited state and a subsequent non-emissive decay.
   **Difficulty:** Hard
2. **Question:** Compound **1** exhibits a paramagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transition. What measurement confirms this observation? 
   **Answer:**  The temperature dependence of the field-cooled magnetization (FCM) and zero-field-cooled magnetization (ZFCM).
   **Difficulty:** Medium
3. **Question:**  What causes the blue-shift in the MV<sup>2+</sup>-Cu<sup>II</sup> emission band of compound **1** upon rehydration?
   **Answer:**  Small changes in the Cu<sup>II</sup>-MV<sup>2+</sup> distance during the adsorption-desorption process.
   **Difficulty:** Medium
4. **Question:** Why does the anhydrous derivative of compound **1** exhibit selectivity for CO<sub>2</sub> over CH<sub>4</sub>?
   **Answer:** The accessible pore size of the anhydrous derivative of **1** is approximately 3.8 \u00c5, allowing CO<sub>2</sub> to enter while excluding larger CH<sub>4</sub> molecules. 
   **Difficulty:** Hard
5. **Question:** Why is it important that compound **1** exhibits different luminescence responses to CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>3</sub>OH, and H<sub>2</sub>O?
   **Answer:** This difference in response indicates that compound **1** is not only sensitive to adsorption loading but also specific to different adsorbates, allowing for their identification.
   **Difficulty:** Medium
6. **Question:**  The anhydrous derivative of compound **1** is amorphous. How can it be converted back to its crystalline form? 
   **Answer:** By immersing the anhydrous derivative in water for several minutes. 
   **Difficulty:** Easy
