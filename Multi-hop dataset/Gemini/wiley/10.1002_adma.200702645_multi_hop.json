    * **Answer:** In Cluster 1, it acts as a 6-connecting node, while in Clusters 2 and 3, it acts as a 4-connecting node.
    * **Difficulty:** Hard
4. **Question:**  Considering the theoretical calculations, what is the primary reason for the observed redshift in the absorption spectra when moving from Cluster 1 to Clusters 2 and 3?

    * **Difficulty:** Hard
5. **Question:** The authors state that the NLO property modulation in clusters 1-3 is not attributed to the heavy metal atom effect. What evidence supports this claim?
    * **Answer:** All three clusters utilize the same [WOS3Cu3]+ building blocks with identical heavy metal compositions. 
    * **Difficulty:** Medium
6. **Question:**  Given the observed self-focusing behavior in the Z-scan measurements, what can be inferred about the sign of the nonlinear refractive index (n2) for Clusters 2 and 3?

    * **Answer:** Cluster 2 has the highest \u03b12 value ((15 \u00b1 1) \u00d7 10\u221211 m W\u22121) indicating the strongest NLO absorption. 
    * **Difficulty:** Medium

**True or False Questions:**

1. **Statement:** The self-assembly process for all three clusters involves a reaction carried out at elevated temperatures.
    * **Answer:** False. The reaction is performed at room temperature.
2. **Statement:**  The crystal structures of clusters 2 and 3 reveal a distorted brick-wall-like layered arrangement within their frameworks.
    * **Answer:** True.
3. **Statement:** The Z-scan technique, employed in this work, utilizes a pulsed laser source to investigate the nonlinear optical properties of the synthesized clusters.
    * **Answer:** True. A 5 ns pulsed laser at 532 nm was utilized. 
4. **Statement:**  The theoretical calculations suggest that the relative weight of the 5d orbitals of tungsten atoms is significantly higher in Clusters 2 and 3 compared to Cluster 1.
    * **Answer:** False. The relative weight is smaller in Clusters 2 and 3 due to mixing with the 4s orbital of copper.
5. **Statement:** The interlayer Cu\u2013Cu distance in these cluster frameworks remains constant regardless of the chosen pillar ligand.
    * **Answer:** False. The distance varies depending on the pillar ligand and its length.
6. **Statement:** Replacing [NMe4]NO3 with either bipy or bpee in the synthesis does not affect the overall honeycomb-like structure of the resulting frameworks.
    * **Answer:** True. All three clusters exhibit a 3D honeycomb-like framework.
7. **Statement:**  The reported hyperpolarizability values suggest that Cluster 1 possesses the strongest third-order nonlinear optical response among the synthesized materials. 
    * **Answer:** False. Clusters 2 and 3 exhibit higher hyperpolarizability values than Cluster 1.
