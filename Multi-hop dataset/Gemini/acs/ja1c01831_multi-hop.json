        "answer": "Under vacuum (DVS), ZPF-2-Co-\u03b2 exhibits minimal water uptake until 10% RH, followed by a steep uptake, reaching 230 mg/g at 95% RH. The desorption isotherm shows a small hysteresis. Under dynamic flow with 30% RH, ZPF-2-Co-\u03b2 rapidly captures water vapor (15 wt% in <10 min) and regenerates quickly (&lt;20 min) at 0% RH. This allows for a water harvesting potential of 7.2 L/kg/day.",

        "answer": "Membranes with a gradient distribution of ZPF-2-Co particles, where larger particles are concentrated near the bottom layer, show bending deformation upon moisture stimulus. This is because the non-uniform distribution creates a difference in swelling behavior between the two sides of the membrane, leading to bending. Membranes with uniformly dispersed, smaller particles do not exhibit bending.",
