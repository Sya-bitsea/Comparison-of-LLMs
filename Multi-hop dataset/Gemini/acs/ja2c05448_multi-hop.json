More C2H6 was subsequently replaced by C3H8, causing a higher \u201croll-up\u201d peak of C2H6 breakthrough curves in ZUL-C2 and ultimately less C2H6 and more C3H8 left in ZUL-C2 than in ZUL-C1.",

        "answer": "The electron-rich carbonyl oxygen coordinated to the metal exhibits a negative electrostatic potential, while the aliphatic rings present a positive electrostatic potential, generating a micro-electric field on the pore surface that is conducive to the polarization of the guest molecules. This polarization, along with the confined aliphatic pore environment created by the specific ring size and number in the ligands, leads to stronger interactions between the gases and the framework, resulting in the observed adsorption behavior.",
