The hypothesized mechanism suggests that the CPA catalysts promote rapid epimerization of the P(III) center, effectively rendering the stereochemistry of the starting phosphoramidite inconsequential to the overall stereochemical outcome.",

        "answer": "Reducing the reaction concentration generally enhances the diastereoselectivity achieved with catalyst P3. A plausible explanation is that lower concentrations disfavor intermolecular interactions between the substrates and catalysts, which might lead to competing pathways and decreased selectivity. Higher concentrations could potentially facilitate these non-selective interactions, diminishing the overall diastereomeric purity of the product.",

        "question": "Why was it necessary to optimize the counterion of the H-phosphonate 13 for the CDN synthesis?",
        "answer": "Optimization of the H-phosphonate 13 counterion was crucial due to the observed autocatalysis in the presence of the triethylammonium cation. Triethylammonium phosphonate, 13\u2022Et3N, underwent a non-selective background reaction, diminishing the desired stereoselectivity. Switching to alkali metal counterions like lithium or cesium helped suppress this undesired background reaction and facilitated the CPA-catalyzed pathway, ultimately enabling high stereoselectivity in the CDN synthesis.",

        "answer": "Catalytic asymmetric approaches, such as the one described in the paper, offer several benefits over chiral auxiliary-based strategies. Firstly, they eliminate the need for multistep syntheses to prepare and install chiral auxiliaries. Secondly, catalytic methods avoid the generation of stoichiometric byproducts associated with auxiliary cleavage. Lastly, asymmetric catalysis often allows for greater flexibility and broader substrate scope compared to auxiliary-based methods, potentially streamlining the synthesis of a more diverse range of P-stereogenic compounds.",

        "answer": "The selectivity decrease when switching the coupling partners likely arises from the distinct steric and electronic environments presented by each phosphoramidite and nucleophile combination. The catalysts, optimized for the guanosine phosphoramidite and adenosine acetonide pairing, might not effectively accommodate the altered steric demands or electronic interactions when the adenosine phosphoramidite is used as the electrophile. Further catalyst tuning and optimization would likely be necessary to achieve comparable selectivities for the reversed coupling.",
