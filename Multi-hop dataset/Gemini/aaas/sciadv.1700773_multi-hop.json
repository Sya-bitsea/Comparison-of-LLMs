        "answer": "The DFT calculations show that incorporating cobalt, manganese, or calcium into the MOF structure lowers the formation energy compared to the pure zinc phase (ZnPF-1). This energy decrease is consistent with the Ostwald ripening process observed experimentally, where a core of zinc-rich MOF is formed first, followed by the growth of outer shells with higher concentrations of cobalt, manganese, or calcium.",

        "answer": "Achieving a homogeneous Zn:Mn:Ca 1:1:1 atomic sequence in the SBUs requires preventing compositional gradients, particularly those caused by cobalt. The synthesis should involve a molar code with a 1:1:1 ratio of zinc, manganese, and calcium salts while excluding cobalt. Since manganese contributes to homogeneous distribution, its presence should ensure an even distribution of all three elements in the final MOF.",

        "answer": "If the MOF synthesized with a Zn:Mn 1:1 molar code exhibits a doubled c parameter, it indicates the presence of two distinct metal sites in the SBUs: tetrahedral and octahedral. Given manganese's preference for octahedral coordination and zinc's for tetrahedral, it can be inferred that the SBUs consist of alternating tetrahedral zinc and octahedral manganese atoms.",

The challenge lies in the potential competition with zinc for the tetrahedral sites, potentially leading to more complex compositional gradients or even disruption of the desired MOF topology. However, it also offers the opportunity to create even more intricate atomic sequences within the SBUs, potentially leading to MOFs with unique properties.",

By adjusting the molar ratios of paramagnetic ions like cobalt and manganese, along with diamagnetic zinc, one can design MOFs with specific magnetic interactions, such as ferromagnetism, antiferromagnetism, or canted antiferromagnetism, leading to materials with tailored magnetic responses.",
