5. **Question:** Based on the DOS analysis, which structural components are considered the major contributors to the optical properties of compound **1**?
   **Answer:** The \u03c0-conjugated [C10H6NO2]\u2212 group, [NO3]\u2212 group, and Cd2+.
   **Difficulty:** Hard
6. **Question:** The calculated theoretical band-gap often underestimates the experimental value. What is done to correct this discrepancy in the calculation for compound **1**?
   **Answer:** A scissor operator is added to shift the conduction band based on the experimental band-gap.
   **Difficulty:** Hard
7. **Question:**  The DOS analysis shows an increase in the peaks of 2p orbitals of N and O at the top of the valence band in compound **1** compared to isoquinoline-1-carboxylic acid. What causes this change?
   **Answer:** The hybridization of the Cd2+ 4d orbital with the 2p orbitals of N and O due to covalent bonding.
   **Difficulty:** Hard

**True or False (7):**

1. **Question:**  Compound **1** is synthesized through a solid-state reaction. 
   **Answer:** False (It is synthesized via an aqueous solution evaporation method.)
   **Difficulty:** Easy
2. **Question:**  The Cd2+ cation in compound **1** has a coordination number of 8.
