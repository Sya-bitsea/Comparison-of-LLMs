**Reasoning (7)**

1. **Question:** Why is the presence of inner-sphere water molecules desirable in a potential MRI contrast agent?
    * **Answer:** Inner-sphere water molecules allow for efficient relaxation of water protons in the surrounding tissue, leading to enhanced image contrast.
    * **Difficulty:** Medium
2. **Question:** Why are macrocyclic ligands generally preferred over their non-cyclic counterparts for complexing Mn(II) for MRI applications? 
    * **Answer:** Macrocyclic ligands often form more thermodynamically stable and kinetically inert complexes compared to non-cyclic ligands, which is crucial for preventing the release of potentially toxic Mn(II) ions in vivo.
    * **Difficulty:** Medium
3. **Question:** Although MnL1 exhibits higher thermodynamic stability compared to Mn(15-pyN3O2), why is it not considered suitable for in vivo applications?
    * **Answer:** Despite the improvement in stability, MnL1 still exhibits fast dissociation kinetics, particularly spontaneous dissociation, making it unsuitable for in vivo use.
    * **Difficulty:** Hard
4. **Question:** How does the presence of the acetate pendant arm in L1 influence the water exchange rate of its Mn(II) complex compared to Mn(15-pyN3O2)?
    * **Answer:** The acetate arm in L1 leads to a faster water exchange rate in its Mn(II) complex compared to Mn(15-pyN3O2). 
    * **Difficulty:** Hard
5. **Question:**  Explain why the first protonation constant (log KH1) of L1 is lower than that of 15-pyN5.
    * **Answer:**  The presence of electronegative oxygen atoms in the macrocyclic scaffold of L1 decreases its basicity compared to the all-nitrogen donor 15-pyN5, resulting in a lower log KH1.
    * **Difficulty:** Medium
6. **Question:** Based on the observed dissociation kinetics, what is the dominant pathway for MnL1 dissociation at physiological pH?
    * **Answer:** Spontaneous dissociation of the non-protonated complex (characterized by k0) is the dominant pathway for MnL1 dissociation at physiological pH.
    * **Difficulty:** Hard
7. **Question:** Why is the kinetic inertness of MnL1 important in the context of its potential use as an MRI contrast agent?
    * **Answer:**  Sufficient kinetic inertness is crucial to ensure that the Mn(II) ion remains chelated and does not dissociate in vivo, preventing potential toxicity from free Mn(II) ions.
    * **Difficulty:** Medium

**True or False (7)**

1. **Question:** True or False: The Mn(II) ion in the MnL1 complex adopts a distorted octahedral geometry.
    * **Answer:** False. It adopts a pentagonal bipyramidal geometry.
    * **Difficulty:** Medium
2. **Question:** True or False: The introduction of the acetate pendant arm in L1 leads to a decrease in the thermodynamic stability of its Mn(II) complex. 
    * **Answer:** False. It increases the thermodynamic stability.
    * **Difficulty:** Easy
3. **Question:** True or False: The MnL1 complex exhibits a single inner-sphere water molecule in its coordination sphere.
    * **Answer:** True. 
    * **Difficulty:** Easy
4. **Question:** True or False: The relaxivity of MnL1 is significantly higher than that of Mn(15-pyN3O2) due to the presence of the acetate pendant arm.
    * **Answer:** False. The relaxivity is lower due to a decrease in hydration number.
    * **Difficulty:** Medium
5. **Question:** True or False: The dissociation kinetics of MnL1 were studied by monitoring the water proton T1 relaxation times.
    * **Answer:** False. The dissociation kinetics were studied by monitoring T2 relaxation times.
    * **Difficulty:** Medium
6. **Question:** True or False: The water exchange rate of MnL1 has a limiting effect on its relaxivity.
    * **Answer:** False. The slow water exchange does not limit the relaxivity.
    * **Difficulty:** Hard
7. **Question:** True or False: The synthesis of L1 resulted in a significant amount of di-substituted side-product when a 1:1 molar ratio of BrCH2COOH and 15-pyN3O2 was used.
