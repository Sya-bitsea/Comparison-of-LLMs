   **Difficulty:** Hard
6. **Question:** What is the yield of (NH4)2Eu(O2CMe)5 crystals from the described synthesis?
   **Answer:** ~26%
   **Difficulty:** Easy

**Reasoning:**

1. **Question:** Why does increasing the ammonium acetate/acetic acid concentration lead to a decrease in the hydration number of Cm3+?
   **Answer:**  Increasing the concentration of acetate ions increases the likelihood of acetate complexation, displacing water molecules from the Cm3+ coordination sphere.
   **Difficulty:** Medium
2. **Question:** Based on the observed trends, would you expect the number of acetate ligands bound to Cf3+ in a concentrated ammonium acetate/acetic acid solution to be more similar to Ac3+ or Cm3+?
   **Answer:** Cm3+, as Cf3+ has a smaller ionic radius and higher Lewis acidity than Ac3+, making it more similar to Cm3+. 
   **Difficulty:** Hard
3. **Question:** Why were the Ac3+ L3-edge inflection points more sensitive to ligand environments than those of Cm3+?
   **Answer:**  This could be due to more substantial orbital mixing in Ac-ligand bonds compared to Cm-ligand bonds.
   **Difficulty:** Hard
4. **Question:** Why is the Cm\u2013OH2O distance shorter than the Ac\u2013OH2O distance in dilute ammonium acetate/acetic acid solutions?
   **Answer:** Cm3+ has a smaller ionic radius than Ac3+, resulting in a shorter bond distance to the coordinating water molecules.
   **Difficulty:** Easy
5. **Question:**  Why does the presence of water molecules provide non-radiative decay pathways for excited Cm3+ and Eu3+ species?
   **Answer:** Water molecules can absorb energy from the excited state and dissipate it as heat through vibrational motions, facilitating non-radiative relaxation.
   **Difficulty:** Medium
6. **Question:** Why was the DGA resin chosen over the DOWEX cation exchange resin for purifying Am3+ and Cm3+ stock solutions?
   **Answer:** The DGA resin provided higher Am3+ and Cm3+ recoveries (>98%) compared to the cation exchange resin (~80%).
   **Difficulty:** Easy
7. **Question:** Based on the presented data, can you definitively state whether acetate binds to Cm3+ in a monodentate or bidentate fashion? 
   **Answer:**  No, the resolution of the data is insufficient to distinguish between these two binding modes.
   **Difficulty:** Medium
