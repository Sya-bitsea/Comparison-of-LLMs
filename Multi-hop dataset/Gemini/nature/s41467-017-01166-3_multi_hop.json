    **Difficulty:** Medium

**Reasoning:**

1. **Question:** Why is the volumetric CO2 adsorption capacity considered more important than the gravimetric capacity for practical applications in CO2 capture from power plants?
   **Answer:** Because capture and separation of post-combustion CO2 is often carried out in a fixed-bed reactor.
   **Difficulty:** Medium
2. **Question:** What structural feature of FJI-H14 is attributed to its higher stability compared to other MOFs based on Cu ions and organic carboxylates?
   **Answer:** The penta-coordinated Cu(II) ion subunit, stabilized by the stronger Cu-N coordination interaction compared to Cu-O, contributes to the higher stability of FJI-H14. 
   **Difficulty:** Hard
3. **Question:** Why is the N2 adsorption at 77 K for FJI-H14 much lower than expected, despite its demonstrated CO2 uptake capacity?
   **Answer:** The relatively narrow pores of FJI-H14 are easily blocked by the larger N2 molecules at 77 K, hindering further diffusion. 
   **Difficulty:** Medium
4. **Question:**  Explain the reason for the increasing isosteric heat of adsorption (Qst) observed in FJI-H14 with increasing CO2 loading.
    **Answer:** The increasing Qst is attributed to the formation of CO2 clusters within the pores of the material, leading to increasing CO2\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7CO2 interactions that contribute to the overall heat of adsorption.
    **Difficulty:** Hard
5. **Question:** What is the role of the open Cu(II) sites in FJI-H14 in terms of CO2 adsorption, and what experimental evidence supports this role?
    **Answer:** Open Cu(II) sites act as Lewis acid sites, preferentially interacting with CO2 molecules. This is supported by the in situ FT-IR spectra showing strong absorption bands red-shifted from the CO2 asymmetric stretch, indicating interaction with the Cu(II) centers.
    **Difficulty:** Hard
6. **Question:** How does the large-scale synthesis method of FJI-H14 differ from the single-crystal synthesis, and why is this method beneficial for practical applications?
    **Answer:**  Large-scale synthesis is achieved by refluxing a mixture of H2BTTA and Cu(NO3)2 in water, resulting in microcrystalline FJI-H14 with a high yield. This method allows for the production of larger quantities of the material, which is essential for its practical application in CO2 capture.
    **Difficulty:** Medium
7. **Question:** Based on the results presented in Table 1, how does the size of the epoxide substrate influence the yield of the cyclic carbonate product in the FJI-H14 catalyzed reaction?
   **Answer:** Smaller epoxides, such as (chloromethyl)ethylene oxide, exhibit higher yields compared to larger epoxides like 1,2-epoxyoctane. This suggests that the reaction likely occurs within the pores of FJI-H14, and smaller substrates can diffuse more easily to access the active sites within the pores.
