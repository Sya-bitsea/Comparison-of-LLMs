**Reasoning:**

1. **Question:** Why does NOF-1 demonstrate better light absorption than NOF-2 between 400-500 nm?
    **Answer:** NOF-1 has significant absorption tailing in that region due to the nitro substitution position on the imidazole ring.
    **Difficulty:** Medium
    **Type:** Reasoning
2. **Question:** Why is the cobalt analogue of NOF-1, [Co(2nIm)2]n, a less efficient NO releaser than NOF-1 itself?
    **Answer:**  The ligand field and low-energy states of the cobalt center deactivate the excited states of the ligands, hindering the photochemical pathway for NO release. 
    **Difficulty:** Hard
    **Type:** Reasoning
3. **Question:** What is the rationale behind using a two-photon near-infrared laser for NOF-1 activation in cell culture experiments?
    **Answer:**  Two-photon excitation using near-infrared light avoids cell damage from UV irradiation while still effectively triggering NO release.
    **Difficulty:** Hard
    **Type:** Reasoning
4. **Question:** How did the authors confirm that the PDMS layer in the NOF-1/PDMS substrate did not hinder the diffusion of released NO?
    **Answer:**  Irradiation experiments showed comparable NO release from both coated and uncoated materials, demonstrating NO permeability through the PDMS layer.
    **Difficulty:** Medium
    **Type:** Reasoning
5. **Question:** Why did the researchers choose HEK293 cells genetically modified to express TRPC5 for their biological relevance studies?
    **Answer:**  TRPC5 is a NO-sensitive transmembrane channel, and its activation by NO leads to a measurable change in intracellular calcium concentration, serving as a quantifiable cellular response.
    **Difficulty:** Hard
    **Type:** Reasoning
6. **Question:** Based on the crystal structures, explain why NOF-1 and NOF-2 exhibit enhanced photoreactivity compared to their individual ligand counterparts.
    **Answer:** The porous frameworks of NOF-1 and NOF-2 provide spatial segregation of the ligands, preventing aggregation-induced quenching of excited states that would otherwise occur in the aggregated ligand form.
    **Difficulty:** Medium
    **Type:** Reasoning
7. **Question:** Why is the transient nature of NO release from the NOF-1 substrate advantageous for studying cellular responses?
    **Answer:** It allows for the observation of dynamic and time-dependent changes in cellular processes, such as calcium influx, upon NO stimulation and withdrawal.
    **Difficulty:** Medium
    **Type:** Reasoning
