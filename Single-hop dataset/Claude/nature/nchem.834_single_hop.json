            "answer": "The relatively long reaction time of 24 hours is likely required to allow the hexacarboxylate ligands and Cu paddlewheel clusters sufficient time to organize and link together into the extended highly porous 3D framework structure of NU-100.",

            "question": "Why are water molecules likely coordinated to the Cu2+ ions in the as-synthesized NU-100?",
            "answer": "Water molecules are likely coordinated to the axial positions of the Cu2+ ions in the paddlewheel clusters to complete their octahedral coordination sphere, since the equatorial positions are occupied by carboxylate oxygens from the ligands.",

        {
            "question": "How does the incorporation of HBF4 acid likely influence the crystallization of NU-100?",
            "answer": "The HBF4 acid likely facilitates the deprotonation of the carboxylic acid groups of the ligand, making them better donors to coordinate to the Cu2+ ions. The acid may also slow down the crystallization, allowing a more ordered framework to form.",

        {
            "question": "Would you expect NU-100 to form the same structure if the reaction was carried out at room temperature instead of 75°C?",
            "answer": "Probably not, the higher temperature is likely needed to provide sufficient energy for the Cu-carboxylate bonds to form and the framework to assemble. At room temperature the reaction may be too slow or lead to a different product.",
