      "difficulty": "easy"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does the second harmonic generation (SHG) intensity of the low temperature phase become much higher than that of the high temperature phase?",
      "answer": "In the low temperature phase, an intense absorption band around 532 nm due to the 1A1 → 1T1 transition of FeII allows strong SHG, while in the high temperature phase the SHG susceptibility tensor elements are very small due to Kleinman's rule in a transparent tetragonal crystal.",

      "difficulty": "hard"
    },
    {
      "question": "What causes the magnetization of the PI-1 phase after irradiation with 473 nm light?",
      "answer": "473 nm light irradiation causes LIESST effect, converting FeII from low-spin to high-spin state. The photo-produced FeII high-spin sites interact antiferromagnetically with neighboring NbIV sites via superexchange, resulting in bulk ferrimagnetic ordering.",
      "type": "reasoning",
      "difficulty": "hard"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does the polarization plane of the output second harmonic light switch by nearly 90° between the PI-1 and PI-2 phases?",
      "answer": "In PI-1, the crystal term of the SHG susceptibility is forbidden but the magnetic term is allowed, resulting in p-out polarized SH light. In PI-2, the crystal term becomes dominant over the magnetic term, switching the SH light back to s-out polarization.",
      "type": "reasoning",
      "difficulty": "hard" 
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the chiral structure of the magnet enable the observed 90° optical switching of the second harmonic light?",
      "answer": "The chiral structure produces the crystal term of the SHG susceptibility, while the photo-induced magnetization generates the magnetic term. Photoswitching alternates between the conditions where the crystal term is much smaller or larger than the magnetic term, enabling the 90° switching.",

      "difficulty": "hard"

    {
      "question": "What is the estimated superexchange interaction constant (Jex) between the photo-produced FeII high-spin sites and the neighboring NbIV sites in the PI-1 phase?",
