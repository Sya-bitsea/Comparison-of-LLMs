  },
  {
    "question": "Why do ZIFs have lower density compared to their zeolite counterparts?",
    "answer": "ZIFs have lower density than zeolites because the Zn-Zn distance in ZIFs is ~6.0 Å due to the longer imidazolate linker, whereas the Si-Si distance in zeolites is ~3.0 Å. This makes the density of ZIFs about 8 times less than zeolites.",
