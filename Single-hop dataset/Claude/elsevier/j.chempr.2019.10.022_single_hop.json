    {
      "question": "Why does the inherent rigidity of the MOFs architecturally stabilize the gold(III) catalyst?",
      "answer": "The inherent rigidity of the MOFs architecturally stabilizes the gold(III) catalyst by precluding the unimolecular decomposition pathway of reductive elimination, since this would require formation of a defect site or strain in the rigid framework.",

      "question": "What evidence supports that catalysis is occurring within the pores of IRMOF-10 rather than on the surface or in solution?",
      "answer": "The impact of substrate size on reactivity in IRMOF-10 supports that catalysis is occurring within the pores. Larger substrates showed decreased or no reactivity compared to smaller substrates, while the homogeneous catalyst was active with all substrates.",
