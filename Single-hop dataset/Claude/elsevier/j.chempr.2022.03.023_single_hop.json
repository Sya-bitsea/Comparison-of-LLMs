    {
      "question": "Why was Nd3+ chosen as the metal ion for synthesizing DGIST-4?",

    {
      "question": "How did the presence of imidazole affect the synthesis of DGIST-4?",

    {
      "question": "What is the proposed mechanism for the formation of NDI radical anions during the solvothermal synthesis of 150-DGIST-4?",
      "answer": "At high temperatures, DMF decomposes into dimethylammonium and formate ions. Electron transfer from the anionic formate to the electron-deficient NDI ligands generates the NDI radical anions, which are charge balanced by the dimethylammonium cations.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Why is the radical-anionic state more stable in 150-DGIST-4 compared to 75-DGIST-4 synthesized at lower temperature?",
      "answer": "The radical-anionic state is more stable in 150-DGIST-4 because of the higher abundance of benzoate auxiliary ligands that shield the NDI radical anions from quenchers. The labile nitrate anions are also released into the pores, allowing for greater structural changes to accommodate the radical state.",

      "difficulty": "hard"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does the thermal post-reduction of oxi-150-DGIST-4 occur more rapidly than that of 75-DGIST-4?",
      "answer": "The thermal post-reduction is faster for oxi-150-DGIST-4 due to a memory effect. The remaining formate anions and higher abundance of benzoate ligands from the solvothermal synthesis accelerate the re-formation and stabilization of NDI radical anions upon heating.",
      "type": "reasoning", 
      "difficulty": "hard"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the mechanism of radical generation differ between thermal reduction and visible light irradiation of 75-DGIST-4?",
      "answer": "Thermal reduction generates NDI radical anions uniformly throughout the MOF crystals. In contrast, visible light irradiation only reduces NDI ligands near the surface due to the absorption and diffraction of light, leading to a non-uniform distribution of radicals.",

      "difficulty": "hard"
    },
    {
      "question": "What structural changes enable the stabilization of NDI radical anions in 150-DGIST-4 according to the DFT calculations?",
      "answer": "DFT calculations show that upon radical formation, the phenyl rings of the benzoate ligands twist to optimize electrostatic interactions with the NDI radical anions. This structural change helps stabilize the radical-anionic state in 150-DGIST-4.",
