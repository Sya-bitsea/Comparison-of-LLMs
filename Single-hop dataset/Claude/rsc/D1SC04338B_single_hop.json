    {
      "question": "Why did the Na-MOF 1-ox display the highest electrical conductivity among the freshly prepared MOFs?",
      "answer": "The Na-MOF 1-ox displayed the highest electrical conductivity because it had the shortest π–π-stacking distance, maximum π-surface overlap, and a large initial population of TTFTCc+ radical cations, which collectively facilitated charge delocalization via TTFTC/TTFTCc+ IVCT interaction.",
      "type": "reasoning",
      "difficulty": "hard"
    },
    {
      "question": "How did prolonged aerobic oxidation affect the electrical conductivity of the K-MOF 2 and Rb-MOF 3?",
      "answer": "Prolonged aerobic oxidation increased the TTFTCc+ population in K-MOF 2 and Rb-MOF 3 to optimum levels, which in turn significantly increased their electrical conductivity compared to the freshly prepared MOFs.",

    {
      "question": "Why was the Cs-MOF 4 resistant to aerobic oxidation of its TTFTC ligands?",
      "answer": "The Cs-MOF 4 was resistant to aerobic oxidation because it had the longest π–π-stacking distance and almost orthogonal orientation of successive TTF layers, providing the poorest conditions for stabilizing TTFTCc+ radical cations through IVCT interactions.",

      "difficulty": "hard"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the predominant charge transport pathway in these MOFs according to DFT calculations?",
      "answer": "DFT calculations indicated that the predominant charge transport pathway in these MOFs was through the π-stacked TTFTC ligands, not the coordination bonds, as the TTFTC ligand orbitals contributed the most to the valence and conduction bands.",

      "difficulty": "hard"
    },
    {
      "question": "How did the experimental optical band gaps differ from the calculated electronic band gaps for the aerobically oxidized MOFs?",
      "answer": "The experimental optical band gaps were narrower than the calculated electronic band gaps for the aerobically oxidized MOFs, as the calculations only considered structural effects while the optical gaps also accounted for the influence of IVCT interactions between mixed-valent TTFTC ligands.",
