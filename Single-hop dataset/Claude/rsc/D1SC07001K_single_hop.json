    {
      "question": "Why does incorporating Ag NPs into the MOF lattice enhance the photothermal properties compared to free Ag NPs?",
      "answer": "Confining Ag NPs in the MOF lattice eliminates their aggregation in the solid-state and enhances their stability compared to free Ag NPs.",

    {
      "question": "What makes MOFs good platforms to design and study photothermal materials compared to other materials?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Why was a TTF-based ligand selected for constructing the redox-active MOF in this work?",
      "answer": "A TTF-based ligand was selected because TTF has stable radical oxidation states (TTFc+) that can extend the absorption wavelength range and enhance photothermal activity.",

    {
      "question": "Why does generating TTFc+ radicals in the MOF enhance the photothermal response?",
      "answer": "Generating TTFc+ radicals extends the NIR absorption of the MOF, which improves the photothermal conversion by absorbing more NIR light.",

      "question": "How do the TTFc+ radicals and Ag NPs work together to enhance the photothermal effect in Ag NPs@Dy-m-TTFTB?",
      "answer": "The TTFc+ radicals extend the NIR absorption while the Ag NPs contribute additional photothermal conversion through their surface plasmon resonance effect. The two work synergistically to maximize the photothermal response.",
