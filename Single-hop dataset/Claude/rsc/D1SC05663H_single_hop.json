  {
    "question": "Why does changing the stoichiometry of 1-Cu and 2-Rh result in different mixed-cage solid structures?",
    "answer": "Changing the stoichiometry impacts the number of aniline donors from 1-Cu that can coordinate to the axial Rh sites of 2-Rh. This leads to different connectivity and dimensionality of the resulting mixed-cage solids.",

  {
    "question": "Why is the Rh-aniline coordination critical for the pairwise linking of 1-Cu and 2-Rh into mixed-cage MOFs?",
    "answer": "The Rh-aniline coordination is critical because it is highly directional and preferential over Cu-aniline coordination. This allows for rational and predictable linking of the two MOCs into well-defined structures.",

  {
    "question": "Why do the authors propose that DMA competes more strongly than DMF for coordination at the Rh paddlewheel sites?",
    "answer": "The authors propose this because 3 forms spontaneously in DMF but requires diffusion of a non-coordinating solvent to form in DMA. This suggests DMA coordinates more strongly and competes with the Rh-aniline linking.",

  {
    "question": "What structural features of the Cu paddlewheel complex may contribute to the preference for Rh-aniline over Cu-aniline coordination?",
    "answer": "The DFT optimized structure of the Cu-aniline paddlewheel complex shows tilting of the Cu-O-O-Cu dihedral angles and a shorter Cu-N bond compared to the Rh analog. This suggests increased steric hindrance for aniline coordination to Cu.",
