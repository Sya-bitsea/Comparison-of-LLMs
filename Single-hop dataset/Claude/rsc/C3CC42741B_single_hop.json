  {
    "question": "Why does the emission wavelength of complexes 1 and 2 increase with decreasing temperature?",
    "answer": "As the temperature decreases, the Cu-Cu distances become shorter, increasing the bonding character and lowering the excited state energy levels. This reduces the energy gap between excited and ground states, leading to emission at longer wavelengths.",

  {
    "question": "What structural feature is responsible for the 2D entanglement in the crystal structure of complex 1?",
    "answer": "In complex 1, a pair of identical 2D single nets interpenetrate in a parallel fashion, with the square centers of one net located in the middle of the edges of the second net. This interpenetration of the large windows prevents formation of channels and leads to an overall 2D entanglement.",

  {
    "question": "What causes the structural differences between complexes 1 and 2?",

  {
    "question": "How does the degree of interpenetration in complex 2 lead to a 3D entangled structure?",
    "answer": "In complex 2, each window of one 2D net is simultaneously catenated by two other nets. Although the interpenetrating nets have parallel mean planes, they are offset rather than coincident. This polycatenation of the large windows leads to an overall 3D entangled structure rather than 2D.",

    "question": "What two factors enable the high degree of entanglement in the structure of complex 2?",

    "answer": "In conventional Cu4I4(pyridine)4 clusters, luminescence thermochromism arises from two emission bands whose relative intensities change with temperature. However, in complexes 1 and 2, a single cluster-centered emission band undergoes a large red-shift with decreasing temperature without splitting.",
