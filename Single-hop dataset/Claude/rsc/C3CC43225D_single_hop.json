  {
    "question": "Why do the chiral MOF catalysts exhibit enhanced enantioselectivity compared to the homogeneous TiL catalyst?",
    "answer": "The increased enantioselectivity may arise from geometrical constraints imposed by the unique chiral micro-environments around the site-isolated Ti centers in the MOFs, which may effectively restrict molecular motion, leading to efficient enantiodiscrimination.",

    "difficulty": "hard"
  },
  {
    "question": "What evidence suggests that the asymmetric sulfoxidation reaction occurs inside the pores of the chiral MOF catalyst rather than on the surface?",
    "answer": "When a sterically bulky substrate benzyl 2-naphthyl sulfide was subjected to the oxidation conditions, less than 5% conversion was observed with MOF 1 compared to 88% with the homogeneous TiL catalyst. This suggests the bulky substrate cannot access the catalytic Ti sites inside the porous MOF structure.",

  },
  {
    "question": "Why does MOF 1 exhibit lower turnover frequency (TOF) compared to the homogeneous TiL catalyst for sulfoxidation reactions?",
    "answer": "The lower TOF of MOF 1 is likely due to the slower diffusion of substrates in the porous MOF structure, which makes the access of the substrate to the active Ti sites slower compared to the homogeneous system.",

    "difficulty": "medium"
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the introduction of electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups on the sulfide substrate affect the catalytic performance of MOF 1?",
    "answer": "Introduction of an electron-withdrawing -NO2 group led to slightly lower conversion, while an electron-donating -OMe group gave comparable conversion and enantioselectivity to the unsubstituted substrate. Substrates with electron-rich aryl groups tended to give higher enantioselectivities.",

  {
    "question": "What structural features of MOF 1 contribute to its ability to act as an enantioselective heterogeneous catalyst?",
    "answer": "The channel surfaces of MOF 1 are uniformly lined with chiral Ti2L2(μ2-O) units with accessible Ti sites pointing to the open channels. This provides a unique chiral microenvironment that enables enantioselective sulfoxidation catalysis.",

  },
  {
    "question": "How does the size of the alkyl group on the sulfide substrate affect the catalytic activity of MOF 1?",
    "answer": "Increasing the size of the alkyl group from methyl to isopropyl still gave good conversion, but a bulkier benzyl group significantly decreased the conversion, likely due to slower mass-diffusion of the bulky substrate in the porous MOF structure.",

    "difficulty": "medium"
  },
  {
    "question": "What experimental evidence confirms that MOF 1 is acting as a truly heterogeneous catalyst without leaching of active species?",
    "answer": "Filtration tests showed the supernatant solution after catalyst removal did not catalyze further oxidation. ICP analysis also showed negligible metal leaching from the MOF. The recycled MOF retained its crystallinity and catalytic activity over multiple cycles.",
