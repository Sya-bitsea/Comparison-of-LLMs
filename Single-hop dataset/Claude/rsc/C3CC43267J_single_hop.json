    {
      "question": "Why does the ferromagnetic coupling between the radical ligands likely occur through the La(III) ions and not directly between the radicals?",
      "answer": "The crystal packing indicates that the radical ligands are well-isolated from one another, implying that the magnetic coupling pathway is through the La(III) ions and not direct coupling between the radicals.",

    {
      "question": "Why is it unreasonable to suggest the empty 6s orbital of La(III) as the sole conduit for the superexchange coupling between the radical ligands?",
      "answer": "The spherical shape of the 6s orbital ensures an orthogonal overlap with the π* SOMOs of both boaDTDA radicals bridged by the La(III) ion, prohibiting a superexchange mechanism based on delocalization. A spin polarization mechanism through the 6s orbital would result in antiferromagnetic coupling instead.",

    {
      "question": "What properties of the early lanthanide(III) ions promote the formation of the 1D coordination polymer?",
      "answer": "The ability of early lanthanide(III) ions like La(III) to accommodate 9- or 10-coordinate ligand arrangements promotes the formation of the 1D coordination polymer in the solid state by facilitating the bridging of two DTDA-based ligands.",
