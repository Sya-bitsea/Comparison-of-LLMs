    {
      "question": "Why does the tetrahedral BF4− anion not induce the formation of the H1 macrocycle?",
      "answer": "The BF4− anion does not induce the formation of the H1 macrocycle because it has a poor metal-coordination ability and prefers to establish anion–π interactions with the heteroaromatic rings coordinated to the metal centers.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the binding mode of the tosylate anion in the 2TsO−@H1 complex differ from that of nitrate in 2NO3−@H1?",
      "answer": "In 2TsO−@H1, each sulfate group of tosylate interacts with one Ag+ ion of the host and the N–H groups furthest from that Ag+. This results in a different conformation of the aliphatic chain connecting the N-H groups compared to the nitrate complex.",

    {
      "question": "Why are additional Ag+ ions required to obtain suitable crystals of the 2NO3−@H1 and 2NO3−@H2 complexes?",
      "answer": "A large excess of AgNO3 is required to obtain suitable crystals of 2NO3−@H1 and 2NO3−@H2 because the additional Ag+ ions coordinate to the external nitrogen atoms of the pyrimidine rings and interact with further nitrate anions, helping to form the 3D crystal structure.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How do the recognition modes of the encapsulated nitrate anions differ between the 2NO3−@H1 and 2NO3−@H2 complexes?",
      "answer": "In 2NO3−@H1, the nitrate anions only interact with the macrocycle via hydrogen bonds. In contrast, the nitrates in 2NO3−@H2 are bonded to Ag+ ions belonging to two neighboring macrocycles in addition to the hydrogen bonding interactions.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What interactions are responsible for the formation of the 3D structure in the 2NO3−@H1 complex?",
      "answer": "Stacking interactions between macrocyclic complexes, CH(pyrimidine)···O(nitrate) hydrogen bonds, and the external silver nitrate bi-dimensional net are responsible for the formation of the 3D structure in 2NO3−@H1.",
