      "question": "Why does the 13C NMR signal of the tertiary C atom adjacent to S shift downfield in the intermediate compared to the starting material?",
      "answer": "The downfield shift of the 13C NMR signal of the tertiary C atom adjacent to S in the intermediate suggests the AgI ions are connected to [Au(d-Hpen-S)2]- through the S atoms, since AgI has a tendency to coordinate to soft thiolato groups.",

    {
      "question": "Why is the Cl- ion essential for the formation of the final supramolecular structure?",
      "answer": "The Cl- ion is essential because it is incorporated in the center of each supramolecular cage. When CuNO3 was used instead of CuCl2, the final product did not form, showing the Cl- is necessary to template the cage structure.",

      "question": "How is the overall charge of each supramolecular cage ingeniously regulated to enable the formation of the rock-salt lattice?",
      "answer": "The overall charge of each cage is ingeniously regulated by the attachment of neutral [AgCl]0 or cationic [Ag(H2O)]+ fragments, such that 20-nuclear monocationic and 21-nuclear monoanionic cages are formed which can then combine into the rock-salt lattice.",
