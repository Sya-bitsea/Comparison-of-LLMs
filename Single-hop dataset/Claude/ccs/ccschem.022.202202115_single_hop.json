s a summary of the key points from the research article:

- The authors report control of competitive E-Z photoisomerization and photodimerization reactions of diaryl alkene substrates within porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) by fine-tuning the pore microenvironments using different dicarboxylate linkers. 

- MOFs with small pores ((E)-X⊂MOF1 and (E)-X⊂MOF1') favor the photoinduced E-Z isomerization of one encapsulated diaryl alkene substrate. MOFs with large pores (((E)-X)2⊂MOF2) prefer the photodimerization of two encapsulated alkene substrates. 

- Both the E-Z isomerization and dimerization reactions show broad functional group compatibility and proceed stereospecifically in good yields under mild conditions. 

- The high local concentration of diaryl alkene ligands and their preorientation within the MOF pores facilitate the stereoselective dimerization reaction.

- By using different dicarboxylate linkers (SDB2−, MDB2−, and BDC2−), the pore sizes and microenvironments of the MOFs could be tuned to selectively encapsulate either monomer or dimer alkene substrates. 

- This pore engineering strategy allows control over the competition between photoinduced E-Z isomerization and dimerization by modulating the MOF pore microenvironments. It provides a promising approach for solid-state synthesis of cyclobutane and cis arene alkene derivatives with excellent selectivity.

In summary, the rational design of MOF pore microenvironments enables selective photochemical reactions of confined guest molecules that cannot be replicated in solution. The pore engineering strategy is applicable to control other photoinduced organic transformations within porous MOFs
