        "question": "Why does the trimethyl BTC ester not form a MOF with copper ions?",
        "answer": "The trimethyl BTC ester lacks free carboxylate groups necessary for interaction with metals in solution and therefore cannot form a metal-carboxylate MOF.",

        "question": "Why is the dimethyl BTC ester unlikely to form a polymeric material with copper ions?",
        "answer": "The dimethyl BTC ester possesses only one free carboxylate group that can coordinate to a metal, limiting its ability to form a polymeric structure. Any resulting complex is likely to remain in solution.",

    {
        "question": "How does the formation of STAM-1 influence the equilibrium of esters in the synthesis solution?",
        "answer": "As STAM-1 precipitates out of solution, it depletes the concentration of monomethyl BTC ester, perturbing the equilibrium and promoting further formation of monomethyl BTC from the di- and trimethyl esters. This drives the reaction towards complete conversion to STAM-1.",

        "answer": "The structural changes upon dehydration, likely closing one set of pores, restrict the access of CO2, N2, and N2O, leading to lower observed pore volumes.",

        "answer": "Unlike CO2, N2, and N2O, both methanol and water adsorption exhibit gated behavior and access higher pore volumes, suggesting an induced structural change that allows access to both types of channels.",
