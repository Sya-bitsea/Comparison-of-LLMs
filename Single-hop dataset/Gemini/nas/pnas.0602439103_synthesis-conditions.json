        "question": "What is the general synthetic procedure for synthesizing ZIFs?",
        "answer": "All ZIFs were synthesized using solvothermal methods. Highly crystalline materials were obtained by combining the requisite hydrated metal salt (usually nitrate) and imidazole-type linker in an amide solvent such as N,N-diethylformamide (DEF). The resulting solutions were heated (85\u2013150\u00b0C) wherefrom ZIFs precipitated after 48\u201396 h and were readily isolated.",
