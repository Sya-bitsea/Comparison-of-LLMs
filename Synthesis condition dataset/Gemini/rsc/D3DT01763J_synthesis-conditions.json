Next, the catalyst Pd (PPh3)4 (0.025 mmol, 1.10 mg) was added and a mixture of 1, 4-dioxane/H2O 150 mL (V : V = 3 : 2) was injected through the rubber diaphragm. After that, the temperature was raised to 95 \u00b0C, and the solution was stirred under reflux and the reaction was tracked via thin-layer chromatography to its end. The temperature was lowered to room temperature and the 1,4- dioxane was spun off. The aqueous mixture was extracted three times with ethyl acetate. The combined organic layer was dried on anhydrous MgSO4, then filtered and vacuum concentrated. The crude product was purified using column chromatography (silica gel, petroleum ether/ethyl acetate = 5 : 1) to afford a white solid. After hydrolysis and acidification, off-white DTDA was obtained.",
