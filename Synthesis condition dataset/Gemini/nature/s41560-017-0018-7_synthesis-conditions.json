The green solid was then collected from the suspension by centrifugation and washed with DMF (50 ml). The obtained solid was further soaked in hot DMF (100 ml, 80 \u00b0C) for 24 h and then collected and washed three times with DMF. The DMF-washed sample was further soaked in water (200 ml) for 24 h at room temperature and then washed three times with fresh water to obtain the freshly made BUT-8(Cr) sample. Finally, the freshly made product was washed with methanol and dried under a vacuum at 60 \u00b0C for 12 h to obtain dried BUT-8(Cr)."
