After the NO2 gas escaped, the orange yellow solutions quickly changed to purple, and then 50 ml of water was added to the solution immediately to stop the reaction. Then, tetrabutylammonium bromide (9.7 g, 30 mmol) was slowly added to precipitate the (Bu4N)3W(CN)8\u00b72H2O. The product was filtered and washed three times with water. The final product (10.2 g) was obtained in 86% yield, based on [W(CN)8]4\u2212."

The colour of the solution changed from colourless to greenish yellow, and finally to orange yellow. The solution was then kept at 40 \u00b0C for 20 min. After the solution was cooled to the ambient temperature, 50 ml of ethanol was added to precipitate the K4W(CN)8\u00b72H2O. The crude product was separated by filtration and dissolved in 20 ml of water. Activated charcoal was added to the solution, and then the solution was heated to boiling for 10 min. When cooling down, the charcoal was removed and 50 ml of ethanol was added to the solution. The product was filtered and washed with ethanol and ether three times. The final product (6.6 g) was obtained in 74% yield based on [WO4]2\u2212."
