      "step 1": "Reactants were charged in a 20 ml Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave.",
      "step 2": "The autoclave was heated at 190 °C for 24 h and then cooled down to room temperature spontaneously.",
      "step 3": "A mixture of green powder and large bright-green single crystals was collected through filtration.",
      "step 4": "The green powder of BUT-8(Cr) was separated from the mixture by stirring in DMF, allowing single crystals to settle, and collecting the suspension with green powder.",
      "step 5": "The green solid was collected from the suspension by centrifugation and washed with DMF (50 ml).",
      "step 6": "The obtained solid was further soaked in hot DMF (100 ml, 80 °C) for 24 h and then collected and washed three times with DMF.",
      "step 7": "The DMF-washed sample was further soaked in water (200 ml) for 24 h at room temperature and then washed three times with fresh water to obtain the freshly made BUT-8(Cr) sample.",
      "step 8": "The freshly made product was washed with methanol and dried under a vacuum at 60 °C for 12 h to obtain dried BUT-8(Cr)."
