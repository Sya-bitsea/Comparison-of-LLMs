To the resulting yellow solution was slowly added a water solution (50 ml) of sodium azide (1.9 g, 2.9 mmol) over 20 min, and the mixture was stirred for 30 min at 0°C and for 12 h at room temperature. The resulting precipitates were collected by filtration and washed with water to give the product (5.4 g, 94%)."

To this suspension, oxone (1.23 g, 2 mmol) dissolved in water (10 ml) was added and the resulting suspension was stirred for 20 min at room temperature. After separation of the layers, the aqueous layer was extracted with dichloromethane three times. The combined organic solution was washed with 1 N HCl and brine, dried over Na2SO4 and evaporated to dryness to give a crude product, which was subjected to recycling preparative size-exclusion chromatography with tetrahydrofuran as an eluent. The second fraction was collected and evaporated to leave H2NO-ipa as solid (23 mg, 12%)."
