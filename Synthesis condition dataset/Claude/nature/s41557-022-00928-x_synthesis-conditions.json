The key points are:
- The reactants are 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid, functionalized 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (X = -NH2 or -NO2), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, and 4,4'-bipyridine in specific molar ratios
- The solvents used are DMF and EtOH at defined concentrations for the different reactants
- The synthesis involves dissolving and mixing the reactants at 373.15 K, keeping the mixture at this temperature for 24 h, cooling, collecting the precipitate, washing with DMF and EtOH, and drying under vacuum
- The yield is 90-98% giving 6-6.9 g of product
