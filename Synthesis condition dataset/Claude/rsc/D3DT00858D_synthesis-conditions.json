The key points are:

- The powder synthesis involves mixing the reactants (anilinium)3[FeIII(dto)3]·3H2O, FeCl2·4H2O and nPrPh3P bromide in methanol under Ar atmosphere in an ice bath for 15 minutes. This yields a black precipitate with 27% yield.

- The single crystal synthesis uses a liquid-liquid diffusion method in a glass tube. The reactants are dissolved in methanol with a small amount of ascorbic acid added. After 2 weeks at room temperature, black hexagonal prismatic crystals are obtained.
