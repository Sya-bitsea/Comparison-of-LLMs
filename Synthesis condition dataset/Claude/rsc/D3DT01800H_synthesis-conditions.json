The key points are:

1. There are two materials synthesized - [Er(CA)(ACA)(DMF)(H2O)]n (1) and [Er0.17Y0.83(CA)(ACA)(DMF)(H2O)]n (1@Y). The synthesis conditions are separated for each.

2. For material 1, the chemicals used (ErCl3·6H2O, H2CA, HACA) and their amounts are specified. The solvents DMF and H2O and their amounts are also given. 

3. The synthesis procedure for 1 involves ultrasonication to dissolve the mixture, followed by heating at 96°C for 9.5 hours. The after procedure steps of cooling, collecting crystals, washing and drying are mentioned.

4. The yield of 54.3% based on H2CA is provided for 1.

5. For material 1@Y, it is mentioned that the same procedure as 1 is used, but with ErCl3·6H2O and YCl3·6H2O in a 1:7 molar ratio. The amounts of H2CA and HACA are not specified for 1@Y.

6. No characterization data is included, as instructed. The focus is only on the synthesis conditions
