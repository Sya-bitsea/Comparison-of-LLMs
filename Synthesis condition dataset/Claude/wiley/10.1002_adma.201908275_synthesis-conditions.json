The key synthesis details are:

1. Two synthesis methods are provided - a slow diffusion method to obtain single crystals, and a fast direct mixing method to obtain powder samples in larger quantities. 

2. The reactants used are K2[Ni(CN)4]·nH2O, Co(NO3)2·6H2O and pyrazine (pyz) in specific molar ratios and solvents.

3. The synthesis is carried out at room temperature for the single crystal method and at 30°C for the powder method. 

4. The activation involves solvent exchange with dry acetone followed by evacuation at room temperature and 363 K to remove guest solvents.

5. The yield for the powder synthesis method is reported as 78% based on pyrazine.
