    },
    {
      "question": "Why does the charge balance require half of the thiomalate ligands to be monoprotonated in the crystal structure?",
      "answer": "To preserve charge balance with the Au:S:Na:Cs ratio of 2:2:2:1, half of the thiomalate ligands must be monoprotonated. This is consistent with commercial Myochrysine being a mixture of monosodium and disodium salts.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the reason suggested for the distortion from linearity of one of the independent gold atoms?",
      "answer": "The reason for the distortion from linearity of one of the gold atoms is not immediately apparent, but it may simply have to do with crystal packing effects.",

    {
      "question": "How does the Au-S-Au angle found compare to previous estimates?",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the likely reason the average of the two close Au-Au vectors agrees well with a previous EXAFS/WAXS peak?",
      "answer": "The average of the two close Au-Au vectors of 3.227 Å and 3.485 Å is 3.356 Å, which agrees well with a previous 3.35 Å peak found by EXAFS/WAXS. This peak likely represents an unresolved composite of the two Au-Au vectors found in this X-ray analysis.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the structure of gold thiomalate compare to a previously reported polymeric silver thiolate structure?",
      "answer": "The structure of gold thiomalate is reminiscent of a previously reported polymeric silver thiolate (AgSR)n structure, which also involves intertwined, double-stranded metal/sulfur chains. The main difference is the repeating unit is octameric (AgSR)8 in the silver case, while it is tetrameric in gold thiomalate.",
      "type": "reasoning",
      "difficulty": "hard"
    },
    {
      "question": "What mechanism was suggested for how the polymeric silver/sulfur chains could rearrange into rings upon dissolution?",
      "answer": "A \"crossover\" mechanism was suggested by which the intertwined silver/sulfur chains exchange Ag-S bonds in a concerted fashion to give rise to octameric rings in solution upon dissolution of the polymeric silver thiolate.",

      "difficulty": "hard"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is there evidence that the solid-state chain structure of gold thiomalate persists in solution?",
      "answer": "Yes, a WAXS/DAS analysis showed virtually the same radial distribution function for gold thiomalate in solution and in a solid-state mull, strongly implying the solid-state chain structure is maintained in solution.",

      "question": "True or false: The two independent gold atoms in the unit cell are both perfectly linear.",

      "question": "True or false: The structure determination confirms gold thiomalate exists as an open-chain hexamer in the solid state, as previously proposed.",
      "answer": "False. While an open-chain hexamer model was previously proposed, this structure determination reveals gold thiomalate actually exists as a polymeric double helix in the solid state.",

      "difficulty": "medium"
    },
    {
      "question": "True or false: It is definitively known that gold thiomalate maintains the same polymeric structure in solution as in the solid state.",
      "answer": "False. While there is strong evidence the chain structure may persist in solution, it is not definitively known if the solution structure is the same polymeric double helix found in the solid state.",
