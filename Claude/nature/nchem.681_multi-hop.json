  {
    "question": "Why does incorporating the photoactive unit within the MOF structure provide advantages compared to conventional methods for studying photoactive centers?",
    "answer": "The MOF acts as a scaffold where photochemical reactions can occur without damaging the crystal, the rigid framework can stabilize reactive intermediates by preventing recombination, and the MOF provides a unique solvent-free environment that may mimic the gas phase.",

  {
    "question": "How does the excited state character of the Re(diimine)(CO)3Cl moiety differ in the MOF compared to typical behavior in solution?",
    "answer": "In the MOF, the excited state has intra-ligand (IL) π-π* character, while in solution an MLCT excited state is typically observed. This suggests the π-π* state is lower in energy than the MLCT state in the MOF environment.",

  {
    "question": "What evidence from the TRIR spectra indicates that the 3MLCT excited state converts to the π-π* state in the rhenium-based MOF?",
    "answer": "The TRIR spectra initially show bands for both MLCT and π-π* states after excitation. The MLCT bands decay rapidly with further growth of the π-π* bands. At longer times, only π-π* bands remain, indicating conversion from MLCT to π-π*.",

  {
    "question": "Why was the manganese analog 2 used to demonstrate the fac to mer photoisomerization by X-ray crystallography?",
    "answer": "The manganese complex has a higher quantum yield for CO loss and fac to mer isomerization compared to the rhenium complex. This enabled a high enough conversion to the mer isomer to be observed crystallographically.",

  {
    "question": "How can the MOF environment help overcome limitations in applying time-resolved crystallography to photoactive molecules?",
    "answer": "Structural changes can occur within the MOF framework without fundamentally altering the crystal lattice integrity. This can reduce laser-induced crystal damage that often limits time-resolved crystallography studies of molecular excited states.",

    "type": "reasoning"
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the proposed explanation for why the IL π-π* state is stabilized relative to the MLCT state in the MOF environment?",
    "answer": "The lack of stabilizing solvent molecules and the presence of the carboxylate groups on the bipyridine ligand in the MOF may combine to raise the energy of the MLCT state above the π-π* state.",

    "question": "What spectroscopic evidence indicates the formation of the mer isomer and CO loss products upon UV photolysis of the MOF?",
