            "answer": "The π-stacking of the coordinated pyridine ligands holds the cobalt-carboxylate layers tightly together, giving the structure a rigid three-dimensional character. The π-stacking of the pyridine guests with the benzene rings of the BTC units enables selective binding of aromatic guest molecules in the channels.",

            "answer": "Infrared spectroscopy experiments show that the compound, after removal of the original pyridine guests, can selectively absorb aromatic molecules like benzene, nitrobenzene, cyanobenzene and chlorobenzene from mixtures with non-aromatic solvents. This selectivity arises from the ability of the aromatic guests to π-stack with the benzene rings of the BTC units.",

            "question": "How does this metal-organic framework compare to zeolites in terms of its properties and potential applications?",
            "answer": "Like zeolites, this metal-organic framework has a rigid and stable open structure that allows for selective inclusion of guest molecules based on size and shape. However, the use of organic ligands allows for more precise control over the pore size, shape and functionality compared to inorganic zeolites. This material is therefore a promising analogue of zeolites for potential applications in catalysis, adsorption and separation.",

            "question": "What is the key strategy used in designing this metal-organic framework to achieve a stable and porous structure?",
            "answer": "The key strategy is using the symmetry and functionality of the organic BTC ligand, which has a rigid disk-like shape with three equally spaced carboxylate groups, to direct the formation of extended metal-carboxylate layers held together by π-stacking interactions. This creates a stable open framework with channels for guest inclusion.",

            "question": "Why was the BTC ligand chosen as the organic building block for constructing this framework?",
            "answer": "The BTC ligand was chosen because it has a rigid conformation with three equally spaced carboxylate groups that can bind to metal ions in the same plane. This allows it to direct the formation of extended metal-carboxylate layers, which is key to forming a stable porous framework.",
