      "answer": "The subtle change from triangular dodecahedron geometry in 1 to biaugmented trigonal prism geometry in 2 leads to observable temperature-independent relaxation for 2 while a faster relaxation with invisible peak for 1 at zero dc field. Under an optimal dc field, both display the typical Raman process with a smaller pre-factor and higher exponent for 2.",
