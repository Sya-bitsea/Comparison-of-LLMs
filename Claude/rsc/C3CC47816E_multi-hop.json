  {
    "question": "Why does polymorph 1 retain its single crystallinity after the photochemical reaction while polymorph 2 does not?",
    "answer": "Polymorph 1, being the thermodynamic product with parallel orientation of the C=C bonds, is able to retain its single crystallinity after the photochemical reaction. In contrast, polymorph 2 with the criss-cross C=C bond orientation does not retain single crystallinity, likely because it is the kinetic product.",

    "question": "What can likely explain the slow transformation of polymorph 2 to the more thermodynamically stable polymorph 1 over time?",
    "answer": "The slow transformation of polymorph 2 to the more thermodynamically stable polymorph 1 over time can likely be explained by a pedal motion of the criss-cross C=C double bonds in 2 to the parallel alignment found in 1.",

  {
    "question": "Why is polymorph 2 considered a kinetic product while polymorph 1 is the thermodynamic product?",
    "answer": "Polymorph 2 is considered a kinetic product because it forms more quickly but then slowly transforms into the more stable polymorph 1 over time. This indicates polymorph 1 is the thermodynamically favored product.",

    "answer": "The Zn-Zn separation distance in the original ladder polymer 1 was 4.005 Å. After the photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition reaction to form 4, this distance elongated to 4.253 Å, likely due to perturbations caused by the formation of the cyclobutane ring.",

    "question": "How does the photoreactivity of polymorphs 1 and 2 relate to Schmidt's topochemical postulate?",
    "answer": "The photoreactivity of polymorphs 1 and 2 is consistent with Schmidt's topochemical postulate. Polymorph 1 has the parallel orientation of C=C bonds required for solid-state photodimerization. While polymorph 2 has a criss-cross orientation, it still undergoes photodimerization, likely enabled by pedal motion to align the bonds.",
