  {
    "question": "Why does the color of compound 1 change from pink to lavender when heated to 369 K?",
    "answer": "The color change from pink to lavender at 369 K is due to the loss of two water molecules from the [Co(H2O)6]2+ ion to generate the four-coordinated [Co(H2O)4]2+ ion, as revealed by SCXRD of compound 2.",

    "answer": "The volume of the unit cell decreases from 3204 Å3 to 3057 Å3 when compound 2 is heated to 413 K due to the complete removal of coordinated water molecules on the guest Co2+ ion, as revealed by the SCXRD of compound 3.",

    "question": "Why is it difficult for the [Co(H2O)6]2+ ion to move out of the cavity in compound 1?",
    "answer": "It is difficult for the [Co(H2O)6]2+ ion to move out of the cavity in compound 1 because the size of the [Co(H2O)6]2+ ion (cal. 5.6 Å) is bigger than the window of the cavity which has a diameter of 3.5 Å.",

  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it difficult to specify the location of the guest Co2+ ion in compound 3?",
    "answer": "It is difficult to specify the location of the guest Co2+ ion in compound 3 because when the coordinated water molecules are removed completely, the constraint on the location of the guest Co2+ ion is weakened. The dispersion of the electron density of the Co2+ ion in the cavity indicates the possibility of the guest Co2+ ion to appear in other locations of the cavity.",

  {
    "question": "What causes the color change of the coordination polymer from pink to violet during the SC-SC transformation cycle?",
    "answer": "The color change from pink to violet is caused by the loss of coordinated water molecules on the guest Co2+ ion, changing its coordination environment. This is confirmed by the DRUV-vis spectra showing the change in absorption bands.",

  },
  {
    "question": "How does the guest Co2+ ion move back to the center of the cavity when compound 3 is exposed to water vapor?",
    "answer": "When compound 3 is exposed to water vapor at room temperature, the water molecules enter the cavity of the coordination polymer and coordinate to the guest Co2+ ion, driving it to move back to the center of the cavity where it gets locked in the form of [Co(H2O)6]2+ as observed in compound 1.",
