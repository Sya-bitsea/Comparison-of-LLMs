      "question": "Why is the birefringence value of C10H6NO2Cd(NO3)·2H2O smaller than expected despite being formed through the combination of multi-planar primitives?",
      "answer": "The birefringence value of C10H6NO2Cd(NO3)·2H2O is smaller than expected because the nitrate ions are not in the same plane as the deprotonated isoquinoline-1-carboxylic acid. If the water molecules could be eliminated to allow the [NO3]− to be coplanar with the [C10H6NO2]− unit, the birefringence could be significantly improved.",
