      "question": "What is the origin of NLO properties in heterometallic clusters?",
      "answer": "The origin of NLO properties in heterometallic clusters is delocalization of the p-electron cloud, derived mainly from the heavy metal atoms that comprise the cluster core and the organic ligands that support the cluster skeleton.",

    {
      "question": "If the NLO properties of discrete heterometallic clusters have been extensively studied, why are studies on heterometallic cluster polymers with strong NLO properties rare?",
      "answer": "Only a few multidimensional (2D or 3D) cluster polymers have been prepared thus far, particularly those with a 3D clusterâ€“organic framework, which is why studies on heterometallic cluster polymers with strong NLO properties are rare compared to discrete clusters.",

    {
      "question": "How does the one-pot self-assembly strategy used in this work differ from the pre-established protocol for constructing extended frameworks?",
      "answer": "The one-pot self-assembly strategy avoids the incorporation of terminal halogen atoms or large counter-ions such as [PPh4]+ that are necessary to solubilize preformed clusters but impede polymerization in the pre-established protocol. This allows for higher connectivity and dimensionality in the resulting frameworks.",

      "question": "What is the key difference between the connectivity of the [WOS3Cu3]+ nest cluster units in cluster 1 compared to clusters 2 and 3?",
      "answer": "In cluster 1, each [WOS3Cu3]+ nest acts as a 6-connecting node with a trigonal prismatic coordination geometry. In contrast, in clusters 2 and 3, each [WOS3Cu3]+ nest serves as a 4-connecting node, resulting in a diamondoid topology.",

    {
      "question": "How do the pillar ligands in clusters 2 and 3 link the [W2O2S6Cu6(CN)3]2- layers compared to the CN pillars in cluster 1?",
      "answer": "In clusters 2 and 3, the bipy or bpee pillar ligands link the [W2O2S6Cu6(CN)3]2- layers in an ABAB stacking pattern, with the pillars perpendicular to the ab plane. This contrasts with the CN pillars in cluster 1 which directly link the layers along the c direction.",

    {
      "question": "How do the DFT results explain the modulation in NLO properties observed across the series of cluster polymers 1-3?",
      "answer": "The DFT results show that the changes in electron density distributions between ground and excited states, with contributions from the atomic orbitals of the bridging ligands, are in accordance with the significant variation in cubic nonlinearity observed. This indicates the pillar ligands are modulating the NLO properties.",
