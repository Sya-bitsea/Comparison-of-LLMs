    "question": "Why does the inclusion compound 1RS formed with the racemic guest mixture retain the original P21/c space group of the host framework?",
    "answer": "The inclusion compound 1RS retains the original P21/c space group because the inclusion of both R and S enantiomers of the guest in equal amounts does not break the centrosymmetry of the structure.",

    "question": "What is the key structural feature of the host Mn3(HCOO)6 framework that enables it to include chiral guest molecules?",
    "answer": "The key structural feature enabling the Mn3(HCOO)6 framework to include chiral guests is the presence of chiral M and P channels formed by the helical arrangement of formate ligands. The chirality of these channels can induce overall chirality in the structure upon inclusion of chiral guests.",

  {
    "question": "How do the R and S enantiomers of the 2-chloropropan-1-ol guest interact differently with the M and P channels of the host framework?",
    "answer": "The R enantiomer fits well in an ordered fashion in the M channels but is disordered over two orientations in the P channels. The S enantiomer shows the opposite behavior, fitting well in the P channels but disordered in the M channels. This suggests the channels exhibit some enantioselectivity in guest inclusion.",

  {
    "question": "What interactions stabilize the inclusion of the 2-chloropropan-1-ol guests in the host framework channels?", 
    "answer": "The 2-chloropropan-1-ol guests are stabilized in the channels by various interactions of the guest functional groups with the channel walls, including CH-π interactions of the methyl and CH-Cl groups, and hydrogen bonding of the OH group with framework oxygens.",

  {
    "question": "How does the inclusion of the chiral guests affect the thermal stability of the host Mn3(HCOO)6 framework?",
    "answer": "The inclusion of the chiral 2-chloropropan-1-ol guests enhances the thermal stability of the Mn3(HCOO)6 framework, with the major guest loss occurring above 100°C. The additional host-guest interactions strengthen the lattice.",

    "question": "How does the magnetic ordering temperature of the Mn3(HCOO)6 framework change upon inclusion of the chiral vs racemic guests?",
    "answer": "The magnetic ordering temperature decreases slightly for 1R and 1S with the enantiopure guests compared to the empty framework 1, but increases for the 1RS compound with the racemic guest mixture. This suggests the guest inclusion subtly modulates the framework geometry and magnetic exchange.",

  },
  {
    "question": "What is proposed to be the origin of the two-step magnetic ordering behavior observed in the guest-included frameworks?",
    "answer": "The two-step magnetic ordering is proposed to arise from competing antiferromagnetic interactions between different Mn-Mn pathways in the framework, such as between adjacent Mn centers along the helical chains vs between Mn centers in different chains. The guest inclusion may modulate the balance between these interactions.",
